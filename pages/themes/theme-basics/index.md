Themes in Bludit are very flexible, you can use any framework ([Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io), [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com), etc), any Javascript code, whatever you want.

All themes resides into `bl-themes` folder, and they have a predefined structure.
