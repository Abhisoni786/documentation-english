# How to change the editor
<!-- Position: 6 -->

Bludit by default uses [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) Editor - a simple and clean HTML editor but you can also choose SimpleMDE which supports Markdown Code. TinyMCE and SimpleMDE are pre-installed on Bludit by default, both are plugins and you can find them in the plugin section.

## How to change to SimpleMDE
- Log in into the **Admin panel**.
- Go to **Plugins** on the left menu.
- Find the plugin **TinyMCE** and click on the button **Deactivate**.
- Find the plugin **SimpleMDE** and click on the button **Activate**.
- Now you have enabled SimpleMDE as editor.
