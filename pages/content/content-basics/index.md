# Content basics
<!-- position: 1 -->

Bludit has five types of content.

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
The pages can be treated as a regular `page` or a `post` (blog post), at the end the concept of `page` is just a name. The pages have the ability to be ordered by `date` or by `position`.

For example, if you are interested in creating a blog you can order the pages by `date` or if you are interested in creating a website with the pages in a specific order you can order the pages by `position`.

Bludit by default ordered the pages by `date`, you can always change this from the settings, go to **Settings > General > Advanced > Order content by**.
