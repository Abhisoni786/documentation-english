<h2 id="content-types">Content types</h2>

Bludit has five types of content:

### Pages
The pages can be treated as a regular `page` or a `post` (blog post), at the end the concept of `page` is just a name. The pages have the ability to be ordered by `date` or by `position`.

For example, if you are interested in creating a blog you can order the pages by `date` or if you are interested in creating a website with the pages in a specific order you can order the pages by `position`.

You can change the order in the settings, go to **Settings > Advanced > Order by**, by default the pages are ordered by date.

### Static
The static pages have the feature to not appear in the homepage but are published and can be accessed via the URL. These kind of pages are useful for pages such as `About`, `Terms and conditions`, `Privacy` or `Contact us`. The themes generally show a link to this pages in the top bar.

To create this kind of page, while you are creating the content, go to the tab **Options** and select the type **Type > Static**.

### Sticky
The sticky pages are the same as a normal page but have the feature to appear in the top of the published pages.

### Draft
The draft pages allow the user to create content and not publish it until is ready. The draft pages are only accessible via the administration panel.

### Scheduled
The scheduled pages are not published until the time of creation set by the user. You can schedule a page for the next minutes, hours, days, weeks or months.

To select the date, while you are creating the content, go to the tab **Options** and set the date in the field **Date**.
