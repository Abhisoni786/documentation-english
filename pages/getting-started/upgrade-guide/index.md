<h2 id="upgrade-from-major-version">Upgrade from the same major version</h2>

The next steps are valid for upgrade any version from the same major version. The major version is the first digit from the value, for example, `Bludit v3.x`.

1. Make a full backup, all files and directories.
2. Remember which version of Bludit you are using for a possible roll-back.
3. Download the latest version from [the official page](https://www.bludit.com).
4. Extract the zip file.
5. Replace existing files with the new files.
6. Clean your cache browser, please read the note bellow.
7. Log into the admin area and check your settings.
8. Done.

> Note: If your website is behind some kind of cache system, for example, Cloudflare provides by default one, you need to purge the files to get the new files, also is a good idea to clean up the cache from your browser. Bludit tries to reload the files with the new ones but some vendors like TinyMCE are not reloading the files and provoke some issues in UI or Javascript errors.

To do the migration, we recommend the tool created by [@anaggh](https://github.com/anaggh), please read the follow considerations and also read the process in his repository. If you have any question you can ask in the [forum](https://forum.bludit.org) or in the [chat](https://gitter.im/bludit/support).

### Consideration before the migration

- Remember to do a full backup before proceeding with the migration, the full backup means copy all files not only from the folder `bl-content`.
- The plugins `Backups` and `Timemachine X` are going to be disabled and their content deleted.
- The migration tool creates a folder `/migrations/` and inside, another folder called `bl-content` with all the pages and databases compatible with Bludit v3.0.
- After the processes of migration, you need to remove all the files and folders except `/migrations/` and install the new version of Bludit.
- After the installation of Bludit v3.0, copy the folder `/migrations/bl-content` to your new installation.
